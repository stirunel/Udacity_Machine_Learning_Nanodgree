    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to plot a histogram of these two features. Note the range of the values present and how they are distributed."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",

    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as our Precision(True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)) as every prediction that we have made with value '1' that should have '0' becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is the total number of records we have in total. \n",

    "\n",
    "Adaboost would be the most appropriate solution for the charity donor problem. Here are my reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Adaboost and Gaussian NB algorithms are quite capable of training on the entire data set as well as perform predictions. Support Vector machine takes a lot of time when training the full data set. If we keep increasing the sample size, then SVC takes a big hit in terms of processing time, while Gaussian NB and Adaboost stays on as possible solutions. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. For all training set sizes, accuracy of Adaboost algorithm is much better than the counterparts Gaussian NB and Support vector machines. SVC comes close in second place, while Gaussian NB falls way behind in third place. Adaboost has two good reasons to be the best choice, while the other two algorithms have one drawback each. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. In terms of F-score, Adaboost again outperforms both counterparts Gaussian NB and support vector machines. Since our target is to accurately detect likely donors, we lean more towards the highest F-score possible. Adaboost stays on top for almost all training and test for different sample sizes. With this Adaboost finished top of the table as the most favored choice for this problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. In terms of suitable algorithm for the data, Adaboost looks the most likely candidate. The dataset has multiple features which could determine the user's ability to be a donor. By building a weak learner model, iteratively for each feature - salary, capital gain, capital loss, and then combine into one single model provides the best possible estimate in terms of accuracy. The dataset lends itself more towards Adaboost than any other algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "So if we rank the three algorithms: \n",
    "\n",
    "F-score:\n",
    "1. Adaboost\n",
    "2. SVC\n",
    "3. Gaussian NB\n",
    "\n",
    "Accuracy:\n",
    "1. Adaboost\n",
    "2. SVC\n",
    "3. Gaussian NB\n",
    "\n",
    "Execution Time\n",
    "1. Adaboost/Gaussian NB\n",
    "2. SVC\n",

    "Algorithm Suitability \n",
    "1. Adaboost\n",
    "2. Gaussian NB\n",
    "3. SVC \n",
    "\n",
    "When we take the above three reasons and ranking into consideration for all training and testing datasets, Adaboost algorithm lends itself as a better fit for the charity donor problem of targeting donors who make more than 50K. We are able to fully utilize the training data (100% of the training samples) and this helps us maximize performance when testing against unseen data, with pretty good execution speed. The accuracy of the detection is quite important in this problem, which leaves Adaboost as the only choice for best solution to this problem. "

    "Adaboost is boosting type ensemble learning algorithm. It works by combining multiple weak hypothesis to create a strong unified model. Each weak hypothesis, when combined together results in better classification which makes the model more capable of predicting accurately when faced with new(unseen) data from the real world. \n",
    "\n",
    "Weak Hypothesis a.k.a weak learner, its a case of predicting some behavior by analyzing one parameter at a time. Finding donors use case, we might end up buiding widely different models if were to consider one parameter - salary or age or hours per week or capital gain etc. This is a weak model, because the behavior doesn't reflect the collective picture of all parameters involved in decision making. So how to fix this? We combine multiple weak learners to create a stronger model. In terms of set thoery, we find the intersection of all the weak learner models to create a strong single predictive model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithm training happens in iterative fashion. Here are the steps: \n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1: For each iteration, the model attempts to correctly classify training data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2: Algorithm assigns higher weights to the observations that it was unable to classify correctly. \n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3: On the second iteration, algorithm focuses on the initially misclassified observations, and tries to classify them correctly (once again). \n",
    "\n",
    "Step 4: Repeat step 2. The algorithm assigns higher weights to misclassified observations from Step3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 5: Repeat steps 1 to 4, until you find the optimial set of weighted hypothesis, when combined will perform well on test data. \n",
    "\n",
    "To make predictions, algorithm uses weak independent hypothesis on which it was trained in the first place. It develops individual predictions, each of them are assigned with appropriate weights to come up with the most probable single strong prediction.  "
